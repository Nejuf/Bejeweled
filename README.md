Bejeweled
=========

An HTML5 JavaScript implementation of Bejeweled.  To run it open up index.html in the browser.  Because of secure file loading restrictions, you probably need to access the file from a local server, rather than your file system(i.e. file://).  This is easy to do if you have Node.js and NPM installed (See here: [http-server](https://npmjs.org/package/http-server)).
